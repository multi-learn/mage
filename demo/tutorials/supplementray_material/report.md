# Generated dataset description

The dataset named `debug` has been generated by [SMuDGE](https://gitlab.lis-lab.fr/dev/multiview_generator) and is comprised of 

* 1998 examples, splitted in 
* 3 classes, described by 
* 4 views.

The input error matrix is 
 
|         |   View 1 |   View 2 |   View 3 |   View 4 |
|---------|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| Class 1 |     0.4  |      0.4 |     0.4  |     0.4  |
| Class 2 |     0.55 |      0.4 |     0.4  |     0.4  |
| Class 3 |     0.4  |      0.5 |     0.52 |     0.55 |

 The classes are balanced as : 

* Class 1 : 666 examples (33% of the dataset)
* Class 2 : 666 examples (33% of the dataset)
* Class 3 : 666 examples (33% of the dataset)

 The views have 

* 50.0% redundancy, 
* 40.0% mutual error and 
* 10.0% complementarity,

the remaining examples are randomly mis-labelled to fit the input error matrix.
