# Generated dataset description

The dataset named `demo` has been generated by [MAGE](https://github.com/multi-learn/mage) and is comprised of 

* 1998 samples, splitted in 
* 3 classes, described by 
* 4 views.

The input error matrix is 
 
|         |   View 1 |   View 2 |   View 3 |   View 4 |
|---------|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| Class 1 |     0.3  |     0.32 |     0.38 |     0.3  |
| Class 2 |     0.35 |     0.28 |     0.2  |     0.15 |
| Class 3 |     0.25 |     0.29 |     0.15 |     0.21 |

 The classes are balanced as : 

* Class 1 : 666 samples (33% of the dataset)
* Class 2 : 666 samples (33% of the dataset)
* Class 3 : 666 samples (33% of the dataset)

 The views have 

* 64.56% redundancy, 
* 1.0% mutual error and 
* 34.53% complementarity with a level of [[3]
 [3]
 [3]].

## Views description

### View 1

This view is generated with StumpsGenerator, with the following configuration : 
```yaml
class_sep: 1.0
n_clusters_per_class: 1
n_features: 3
```

This view has 3 features, among which 2 are relevant for classification (they are the 2 first columns of the view) the other are filled with uniform noise.

 Its empirical bayesian classifier is a decision stump

### View 2

This view is generated with StumpsGenerator, with the following configuration : 
```yaml
class_sep: 1.0
n_clusters_per_class: 1
n_features: 3
```

This view has 3 features, among which 2 are relevant for classification (they are the 2 first columns of the view) the other are filled with uniform noise.

 Its empirical bayesian classifier is a decision stump

### View 3

This view is generated with StumpsGenerator, with the following configuration : 
```yaml
class_sep: 1.0
n_clusters_per_class: 1

## Statistical analysis

Bayes error matrix : 

|        |   Class 1 |   Class 2 |   Class 3 |
|--------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| View 1 |  0.328829 |  0.334835 |  0.25976  |
| View 2 |  0.33033  |  0.282282 |  0.283784 |
| View 3 |  0.369369 |  0.198198 |  0.126126 |
| View 4 |  0.310811 |  0.141141 |  0.189189 |

 The error, as computed by the 'empirical bayes' classifier of each view : 

|        |   Class 1 |   Class 2 |   Class 3 |
|--------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| View 1 |  0.304805 |  0.297297 | 0.363363  |
| View 2 |  0.325826 |  0.280781 | 0.219219  |
| View 3 |  0.381381 |  0.160661 | 0.0975976 |
| View 4 |  0.279279 |  0.148649 | 0.171171  |
